# hello-world
This is me learning how to make a repository! woo!

I am not a programmer. I am a data analytics person, though, so I wear some of the same hats sometimes! This is my attempt to broaden my skillset by learning to do a new thing, because new things are fun.

Hopefully this new thing will be fun and productive, as new things I learn usually are!

Exclamashun pwant!
